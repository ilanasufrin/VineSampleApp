VineSampleApp
=============

### This app hits the Vine API to get all videos from a particular user's timeline. It does this by performing the following tasks:
- Parses and maintains the following API call: https://vine.co/api/timelines/users/918753190470619136
- Create a ListView using the data from the above call, showing the thumbnail and relevant metadata
- Create a Video Detail View that is activated on clicking the individual table cell that autoplays the â€œvideoURL" for the item selected (please note that you must be using an Android phone, NOT an emulator, to view the videos)

The app uses the [Picasso library](http://square.github.io/picasso/) to render the thumbnail URLS and VideoView as a wrapper for the MediaPlayer class.

##### The [screenshots folder](https://github.com/ilanasufrin/VineSampleApp/tree/master/main/screenshots) shows what the app looked like at virtually every stage of development.


#### Ideas For Future Development
- Make it prettier overall
- Add options for user preferences. Allow the user to input a Vine user ID for the API call
- Add controls for a fancier MediaPlayer
- Add a proper backbutton and menu topbar navigation
